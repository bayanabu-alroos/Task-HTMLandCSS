        <p class="a">Loarn mac Eirc was a legendary king of Dál Riata who may have lived in the 5th century. He was buried on Iona.[1] Loarn's main significance is as the eponymous ancestor of Cenél Loairn, a kindred whose name is preserved in Lorne.
            The Duan Albanach and the Senchus Fer n-Alban and other genealogies name Loarn's father as Erc son of Eochaid Muinremuir. Loarn appears in Irish traditions as 'King of Alba' in the eighth- to twelfth-century tale "Of The Miracles of Cairnech Here" in the Lebhor Bretnach, the Irish version of the Historia Brittonum, and in the tenth- to twelfth-century legendary and mythological tale Aided Muirchertach mac Erca. In these tales, mac Erca spends time with Loarn, his grandfather, before murdering him by setting him aflame.</p>

            <b>Inline CSS</b> allows you to apply style rules to specific HTML elements. Inlining CSS means putting CSS into an HTML file instead of an external CSS. Since inline CSS allows the application of a unique style to one HTML element, its usage is limited but is beneficial for creating unique attributes. Advantages of inline CSS are numerous.
            Like images and JavaScript, CSS plays a significant role in influencing the performance metrics of the site. Inlining CSS refers to the practice of integrating a portion of the code directly into the place where it will be used. This makes the code run faster resulting in the rapid loading of pages. Now, let’s dive into some advantages of inline CSS to understand its value in an optimized CSS delivery solution.

            Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are old fashioned dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise.
